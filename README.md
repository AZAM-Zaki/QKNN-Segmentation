**Qiskit Quantum kNN** is a pure quantum knn classifier for a gated quantum
computer, which is build with [**Qiskit**][qiskit-github].

Qiskit Quantum kNN is made as a final project to fulfill a master's degree
at the Radboud University Nijmegen, in collaboration with ING Quantum 
Technology. It is build by using [Afham et al. (2020)][afham2020] as it's
primary guide on how to construct the quantum circuit used for distance
measurements.
